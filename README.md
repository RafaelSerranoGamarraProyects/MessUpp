# MessUpp

This is my first project in mobile development, specifically in Flutter. I chose Flutter because it's a quite easy-to-learn declarative programming framework. I believe Flutter is a great choice for a first experience in mobile development and it opens the doors to understanding native programming languages like Swift or Kotlin.

The concept of the app is very simple, MessUpp, a finance management application for those who forget about their pending debts, both to collect and to pay. An app that allows you to keep a record of all the expenses you have in a given month, as well as pending payments to your friends, third-party companies (such as car insurance, streaming service subscriptions, among others).

It's a straightforward application but it will serve me as an opportunity to delve into mobile development.

I hope you like it :)
